// Package keyfile loads a long-lived key from disk, creating it on first use or storing one it was handed.
//
// Seven products in the suite did this seven ways, and the disagreements were not
// stylistic. kynotes-server continued past a key file it could not decode and left the
// secret an empty string, so the server ran with no pairing secret and no error.
// kypassword-server's audit store regenerated on an empty file, which silently orphans
// every record written under the old key. Five of the seven read and then wrote with no
// exclusion, so two starting processes each minted a key and one won after the other had
// already sealed data. Only one fsynced, so a crash just after first boot left a
// zero-length file for the next boot to misread.
//
// This package refuses rather than guesses: an existing file that does not decode to
// exactly the expected size is an error, never something to replace.
