// through slog's JSONHandler, which marshals time.Time as RFC3339Nano — trimming trailing
// zero fractional digits, down to none at whole-second precision. Pinning to
// RFC3339Nano here, on a value already normalised to UTC by DeclareTime, is what keeps

// Audit records a chain record on the authpriv facility, alongside the same values as
// flat keys — unless fs disagrees with what rec's Fields digested, in which case the flat
// keys are withheld and audit_fields_mismatch marks the line instead of silently shipping
// a flat user_id next to a fields entry that authenticates a different one. The record
// itself — seq, prev, hash, fields — always ships either way: it is what is authenticated,
// and withholding it on a caller's mistake would cost the one thing meant to survive one.
//
// Audit ignores the configured level: it writes the handler directly rather than going
// through LogAttrs, so no KY_LOG_LEVEL can suppress it. An audit record is evidence, not
// verbosity — chain.Append has already advanced the sequence by the time Audit is called,
// and a gap left by a dropped line is indistinguishable from tampering. A verbosity knob
// is not allowed to manufacture a tamper alarm.
//
// The export handed to kyauditverify must be filtered to lines carrying hash: Log and
// Security lines decode into a zero auditchain.Record without a JSON error, which
// VerifyStream cannot tell apart from an attack.
//
// The record's storage stays with the product: auditchain deliberately owns none, and a
// tamper-evident chain that exists only on a machine the attacker may also own is not
// evidence. This ships a copy; the product keeps writing its local chained file.
