// KycapFileFormat identifies the one container this package reads and writes.
//
// It is kycap/3: kycap/2 with the payload sealed to the suite recovery public key through
// HPKE instead of a per-capsule symmetric key the caller had to protect and split. Three
// containers came before it and all are gone: kysignon-server's kycap/1 and
// kyrecovery-server's tar, which authenticated their ciphertext and left the manifest
// outside the AEAD — so capsule_id, service_name, threshold, total_shares and the
// verification recipe could all be rewritten by someone who never learned the key — and
// kycap/2, which fixed that and still handed back a raw key.
//
// Reading them was retired rather than kept: a reader that half-trusts a manifest cannot
// tell a caller which half, and nothing is in the wild.

// than the manifest. It is the budget that list had while it was a manifest field, kept
// identical so that moving it did not quietly raise what a caller's path lengths can reach
// — Seal refuses a list past this, and Open refuses to read one.

// decoding can make additional copies of it. The plaintext ceiling is 256 MiB; this leaves
