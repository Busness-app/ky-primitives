// Seal writes a kycap/3 container sealed to the suite recovery public key, and returns it
// with the manifest it sealed.
//
// The manifest is returned because Seal is the only place CapsuleID, CreatedAt and
// PayloadHash exist: they are minted here and have no other source. Returning only the
// bytes left a caller re-parsing its own output through ReadUnverifiedManifest to recover
// them — reaching for the keyless reader, whose doc comment says not to decide on what it
// returns, to read fields it had just authored. This value is a Manifest because it is the
// one that went into the AEAD, not one read back out of a container.
//
// Seal returns no key. The payload is sealed to a public key through HPKE, the shared
// secret exists only inside crypto/hpke for the duration of this call, and the only thing
// that opens the result is the recovery private key the custodians hold in shares. A
// product that calls Seal holds nothing afterwards that it did not hold before.
//
// That is a statement about confidentiality, not origin: the public key is not secret, and
// a capsule Open accepts could have been sealed by anyone who holds it. Authenticity comes
// from the channel that deposits the capsule, not from the container.
