// Package capsule reads and writes the suite's encrypted backup container.
//
// The container is kycap/3: a JSON object holding the manifest and a base64 ciphertext,
// and nothing else. The payload is sealed to the suite recovery public key through HPKE;
// there is no per-capsule symmetric key and no nonce carried in the container — HPKE
// derives it from the encapsulated key and the key schedule. The manifest is bound in as
// the AEAD's additional authenticated data, so every field describing the capsule is
// authenticated rather than merely present.
//
// Three containers came before it and all are retired: kysignon-server's kycap/1 and
// kyrecovery-server's tar, which authenticated their ciphertext and left the manifest
// outside the AEAD, so the recovery topology a capsule advertises could be rewritten by
// anyone who could reach the file; and kycap/2, which fixed that and still handed back a
// raw key.
//
// The payload is a gzipped tar of the backed-up files, extracted through the hardening in
// extract.go.
