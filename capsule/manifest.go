// the Files field below for why.
//
// Path and Mode are the normalised ones — the relative path extraction writes and the
// owner-only clamp it applies — not the caller's spelling of them, so an entry can be
// matched against the File values Open returns. Seal builds them that way
// (TestManifestEntriesDescribeWhatExtractionProduces), and Open refuses a list that
// disagrees with what it extracted (TestFileListMustDescribeTheExtractedMembers).

// UnverifiedManifest is a capsule's manifest read without its key.
//
// Every field here is attacker-controlled wherever the capsule file is. The manifest is
// bound into the AEAD exactly so that threshold, total_shares and the verification recipe
// cannot be rewritten by whoever reaches the file — that is what kycap/1 got wrong, where
// a 2-of-3 kit could be restated as 1-of-1 and still open. Reading it without the key
// gives that guarantee up.
//
// So it is a distinct type from Manifest. The compiler stops one being passed where the
// other is required, which catches the accident — it cannot stop deliberate construction,
// because Manifest's only field is exported and a caller may write Manifest{...} itself.
// The type is a guard rail, not a proof. Show these fields to an operator if you must; do
// not decide anything on them. Anything that chooses a restore path, a quorum, or a
// verification rule wants Manifest, which only a successful Open or Seal produces.

	// Files is not a manifest field. The manifest is stored in the clear, so a per-member

	// capsule: the digest is an offline confirmation oracle — no key, no rate limit — that
	// recovers any member drawn from a guessable space, and equal digests across two
	// backups prove a signing key was never rotated between them. The whole-payload hash
	// stays in the manifest because it digests a gzip stream whose ModTimes make it
	// unguessable; a per-member digest is a different object.
	//
	// The list travels inside the encrypted payload instead, as reservedFileList, and Open
	// fills this in from there. `json:"-"` is the enforcement: no later edit can marshal it
	// back into the plaintext without deleting the tag.
	// TestFileListNeverAppearsInTheClear holds that.
	//
	// So it is empty on the keyless path, which is the correct answer for a keyless read.
