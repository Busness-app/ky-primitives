// one: they are asking whether a record is already in the shared shape, not whether it is

// Replay builds a whole chain in memory from field tuples and returns its records with the
// anchor they end at. It writes nothing.
//
// Append takes a persist function because the chain's head is a claim about what is on
// disk, and advancing it before the store agrees leaves the next record chained onto one
// that never existed. A bulk conversion inverts that: it rebuilds every record, writes the
// log once atomically, and saves one anchor. Passing a persist that does nothing per record
// would satisfy the signature and mean nothing — do not copy that pattern outside this
// function. This is the shape that fits: the caller still owes one transaction over the
// returned records and anchor together.
