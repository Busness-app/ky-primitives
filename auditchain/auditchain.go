// Package auditchain builds and verifies a tamper-evident hash chain over audit records.
//
// The suite carried three of these. kybookmarks-server fell back to a key committed in
// its own source when none was configured, so anyone who could write the log could
// recompute the chain and verification still passed. Two of the three joined fields with
// a bare "|", so a field carrying the delimiter could be shifted into its neighbour
// without changing the digest — a forged record without the key. And only one kept a
// count and hash outside the log, which is the only thing that catches a log with
// records removed from the end: what remains still chains correctly.
//
// This package fixes the key floor, length-prefixes every field, and makes the anchor
// part of verification rather than an option.
//
// It deliberately owns no storage. The three implementations wrote to JSON lines, to a
// file and to a database, and the divergence that mattered was never where the bytes
// went.
