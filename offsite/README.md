# offsite

`offsite` copies opaque objects to one of four target types behind the same
interface:

```go
type Target interface {
	Put(context.Context, string, io.Reader, int64) error
	Get(context.Context, string) (io.ReadCloser, error)
	Test(context.Context) error
}
```

Products keep target records, seal credentials, schedule work, and write audit
or sync logs themselves.

## Targets

| URL | Credential fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `s3://bucket/prefix` | `AccessKey`, `Secret` | AWS by default; set `S3Endpoint` for R2 or MinIO and `S3Region` when needed. |
| `sftp://user@host:22/dir` | `Secret`, `HostKey` | The path is relative to the SFTP account root. `AccessKey` may supply the user instead. |
| `smb://host/share/dir` | `AccessKey`, `Secret` | `AccessKey` may be `DOMAIN\user`; SMB1 is never negotiated. |
| `file:///absolute/path` | none | Writes owner-only files by temporary file and rename. |

Passwords in URLs are rejected. SMB rejects all userinfo because endpoints are
commonly logged. SFTP never connects successfully without a pinned SHA256 host
fingerprint. Calling `Test` without a pin returns `UnknownHostKeyError` carrying
the fingerprint the operator must verify out of band.

Object names are relative slash-separated paths. Absolute paths, backslashes,
empty components, `.` and `..` are rejected for every target. `Get` returns an
error matching `os.ErrNotExist` only when the object is absent. Callers must
close a successful `Get`; for network targets that also closes the session.

`Test` writes `.ky-offsite-ping`. Local, SFTP, and SMB remove it; S3 overwrites
the same probe object on later tests.

## SMB limitation

The client requires message signing and `go-smb2` supports only SMB 2 and 3.
However, `go-smb2` can accept an unsigned guest session granted by the server.
An impersonating server could swallow uploads while observing the NTLMv2
exchange. Use SMB only on a trusted network and verify replicas independently.
A share mounted by the host and addressed with `file://` avoids this library
limitation.

## Release

This nested module uses namespaced repository tags such as `offsite/v0.1.0`:

```sh
go get github.com/Busness-app/ky-primitives/offsite@v0.1.0
```
